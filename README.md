# Aquarium Filter Outflow Baffle

This is OpenJSCAD source for creating a 3D model of an aquarium water filter
output baffle. This code can pasted in at http://openjscad.org, then rendered
viewed. You can also generate a .stl file for 3D printing this model.

This is a baffle for the water that flows out of the filter that comes with
Minibow Aquariums. This one was designed for the Minibow 5-gallon aquarium
filter, but I believe it will also work for other sizes that use the same
water filter (model: MB1).

Without this baffle, the water output flow from the filter caused enough
turbulence in the aquarium to affect our Betta (especially when it came
near the surface). This tray prevents the direct outflow and allows it to
disperse through the holes in the bottom of the tray.

Another benefit of having this baffle in place is when you are changing or
adding water. You can pour it into the baffle tray which will help minimize
disturbances in the tank.

Generated models based on this code can also be found on the Thingiverse
site at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1796487. The images directory
contain some pictures of a 3D printed version of the model and how it looks
in use.
